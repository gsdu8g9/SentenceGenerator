**The functions in the File "grammar_sd2841.lisp"

	1) random-sentence =>
			Generate random sentences that from the given grammar when provided a phrase from the text 
				eg: (random-sentence 'sentence)
				=>  THE FEW SERVICES AND SOLID PROSECUTION ACHIEVE PREVAILING AS THE DEATH JOB

	2) Generate-tree =>
			Generate the tree of the sentence using the CFG
				eg: (generate-tree rules1)
				=> (SENTENCE
 						(SUBORDINATE-CLAUSE (SUB-CONJUNCTION THAT)
						  (PREDICATE (VERB-PHRASE-PAST (AUXILARY WILL) (VERB-PAST TEND) (ADVERB WILL))
						   (NOUN-PHRASE (ADVERB-LIKE-NOUN THERE))))
						 (PREDICATE (VERB-PHRASE-PAST (ADVERB WELL) (VERB-PAST TEND))
						  (NOUN-PHRASE (ARTICLE THE)
						   (COMPOUND-NOUN (NOUN PROSECUTION) (NOUN-PLURAL GAINS)))))

	3) targeted-sentence =>
			Generate the 5 targeted sentences when provided with the rules to the tree structure.

			eg: (targeted-sentence rules1)
			=> HIGHER EDUCATION MUST COUNTER THE PREVAILING NARRATIVE OF POLARIZATION


	4) write-to-file =>
			Writes the sentences to files when given the file_name and the phrase
				Function prototype: (defun write-to-file (sentence file_name))

	5) loop-run => 
			Generates the random sentences that are valid and by calling the validp() function in a loop to generate 10000 sentences
				This function when called, writes into 3 files
					-> q2_sd2841.txt ==> 100 sentences that have been rejected
					-> accepted_sentences==> all the sentences that have been accepted by the validp()
					-> all_sentences ==> both the accespted and rejected sentence, differentiated with the preceeding + or - sign for the respective cases
			
			eg: command to run: (loop-run)

	6) loop-run-random =>
			Generates the 10,000 random sentences for the first part of the assignment.
			This function calls that write-to-file function and writes into the "q1_sd2841.txt" the 10,000 sentences.

	7) check-duplicates =>
			- This function checks the duplicates in the generated random sentence.
			- This function passes the sentence to the function "repeated()" which recursively searches through the sentences to find duplicate words and returns these words as a list.
			- This list is then checked against a list of valid-words that has Conjuctions, prepositions, articles etc, that can be considered acceptable to be repeated. 
			- If theer are words in the duplicate list that donot belong to the valid-words list then that sentence is rejected.
	8) check-length
			Checks if the random sentence is less than the given length. (Assumption taken to be 20)
	9) check-single-words
			Checks if sentence that is generated is a single word sentence and if they belong to the list of valid words
	10) check-end-word
			Checks if the random sentence that is generated is not ending with a word that is not valid.
	11) check-consecutive
			Checks if consecutive words in the sentence are same or not
	12) Validp =>
		Calls the following functions:
			- check-duplicates,
			- check-length
			- check-single-words
			- check-end-word
			- check-consecutive
		Input given to the function - random sentence
		and the returns 't' if the sentence passes all the tests of validity or else returns 'nil' and rejects the sentence.

**Requirements of the Assignment:

	Part I) Context Free Grammar:
			1) Building a sophisticated Grammar:
				-> Added various Non- Terminals as mentioned above
				-> Added sophisticated production rules as mentioned above
				-> Created non-terminals that handles complex sentences like singular or plural nouns, present or past tense verbs, transitive and intransitive verbs, Adverb-like-Nouns, Clauses and various types of sentences.
				-> Added various Teminal Symbols as mentioned above.
				-> Output file "q1_sd2841.txt" contains 10,000 random-sentences.
			2) Create rules to generate specified sentences:
				Created 5 rules:
					rules1, rules2, rules3, rules4, rules5.

	Part II) Rejecting Sentences:
		1) check-length 	: Function to reject sentences that are too long
		2) Check-duplicates 	: Rejects sentences that generates same word twice
		3) Check-single-words 	: Rejects sentences that are one-word long
		4) check-end-word	: Rejects sentences that end with an invalid word.
		5) Check-consecutive	: Rejects sentences that have consecutive words repeating.
